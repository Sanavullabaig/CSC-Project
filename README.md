 Prints the top coordinate of the bounding box
 Prints the left coordinate of the bounding box
 Prints the width of the bounding box
 Prints the height of the bounding box
 Prints the confidence score for the specific instance
 Prints a header for parent labels (hierarchical classification)
 Iterates through any parent labels associated with the current label
 Prints the name of the parent label with indentation
 Prints a separator line for clarity
 Prints an empty line for better formatting
